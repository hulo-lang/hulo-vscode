> Hulo-VSCode is the official VSCode extension for the [Hulo language](https://github.com/hulo-lang/hulo), a modern DSL that compiles to Bash, PowerShell, and VBS.  
> This plugin provides syntax highlighting, language support, and a better editing experience for Hulo scripts.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### From the VSCode Marketplace

1. Open VSCode.
2. Go to the **Extensions** view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
3. Search for **Hulo Language Support**.
4. Click **Install**.

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hulo-lang/hulo-vscode
cd hulo-vscode
npm install
npm run compile
npx vsce package
```
Then:

1. This will generate a `.vsix` file (e.g., `hulo-vscode-1.0.0.vsix`).
2. Open VSCode.
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) to open the Command Palette.
4. Run the command: **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**
5. Select the generated `.vsix` file.
6. Reload the window when prompted.

You should now see Hulo syntax highlighting, diagnostics, and other language features enabled.
